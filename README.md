# updatedPortfolio

For this assignment I was able to update my portfolio with my recent group project and the assignments that I have done throughout the course. I decided to start a new portfolio from scratch while using some of the code from the original portfolio and also applying bootstrap to help with the some of the styling.

Steps:
    Insert images from projects that will be displayed on the portfolio
    Link bootstrap in order to use the nav bar and containers
    Add links to images of projects that takes user to the live links
    Make sure all nav bar links are working and add a pdf link to a resume page
    Put effects on the project images upon hover
    Allow for links to be easily placed into the contact me section
